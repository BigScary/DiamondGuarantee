# DiamondGuarantee

I created this Minecraft server plugin using the Bukkit API to fix starvation issues with rare resources like diamonds, glowstone, nether wart, and elytras.  In Vanilla multiplayer, all of these quickly disappear from areas of the world, making it difficult for players who come later to gather those resources.  DiamondGuarantee ensures that players who are making a real effort (as opposed to trying to farm or cheat) will find those resources.  For example, it will add new diamond ores for players who are mining to find, and adds glowstone dust / nether wart drops to some nether monsters (with some anti-farming logic as well), and guarantees the ender dragon will drop an elytra on death.

I stopped working on this project after Minecraft 1.10.  Anyone may use my source code to continue the project, but see the LICENSE file for restrictions.
